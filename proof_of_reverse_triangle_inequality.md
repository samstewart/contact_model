The most interesting contribution of Juliette Venel's papers is a proof of a reverse triangle inequality.

The key technical lemma is to prove that  

Q: can we rephrase these results in terms of flow networks? In this case $\lambda_ij$ would be the flow with the constant capacity constraint $\lambda_ij < a^n \abs{F}$.

What is the relationship between the l^1 and l^2 norm? The l^2 ball is bigger so l^1 is smaller. What inequality do we use to prove this?

We want to prove that bound $\lambda_ij < a^N \abs{F}$ where the double brackets indicate the l^1 norm.

l^2 ball is convex and l^1 boundary is a straight line so l^1 ball must be contained in l^2 ball.

Q: what is the connection between the graph Laplacian minimization problem and the bilinear form? How does that relate to this Laplacian/pressure analogy that Maury discusses?

We iteratively construct the bound 

Case 1:
Guy i has only one neighbor (end of chain). Then $\lambda_ji = \abs{F_i}$. 

Case 2: look at boundary of cluster
Q: why don't we have more than three neighbors?
2a) only two neighbors
2b) only three neighbors
